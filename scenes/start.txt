-- STARTING THE SEMESTER --

A new semester is beginning. How refreshing!
You can barely wait to start helping your students learn the wonders of computational linguistics algorithms.
You have 8 students in your list and two assignments to grade and discuss in class.
Actually, the first batch of submissions have started to come!
Do you want to begin grading immediately, take some free time to refuel your energy or check the list of participants?
